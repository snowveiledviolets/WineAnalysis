# Wine Datasets

In this notebook, I will be looking at two wine datasets (one for white wines, one for reds). 
The goals here are to practice exploratory data analysis and some different visualization techniques, 
and later to use machine learning models to try to predict wine quality ratings. I would always appreciate 
any feedback available!
